How to connect to app using websocket client "wscat" ("curl" can't connect to it without the required plugin)


if the app uses TLS, then the “wss” protocol is used:
 wscat -n -H "Host:test.com" -c wss://<ip>

if the app insecure, w/o TLS, then the “ws” protocol is used:
 wscat -H "Host:test.com" -c ws://<ip>

Example:

 wscat -c ws://3.22.117.239:31500/ 
Connected (press CTRL+C to quit)
> hello
< You said: hello
> %
